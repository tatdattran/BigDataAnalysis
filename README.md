# Big Data Analysis

## Introduction

You work as a data scientist in a start-up. You opened your business a year ago and now you want to take the next step and expand your services. Your business model is to operate a platform where people who have a business idea but do not have the required money can register and collect money for their project within a given time. On the other hand, you have financiers who would like to invest their money in projects and who are looking for investments. As an intermediary, your platform brings together borrowers and lenders. You earn your money with a commission for every project that lands on your platform. Your database is the history of your platform. All projects are completed projects, i.e. the time to raise money for your project has expired. Your business model stipulates that the money collected will be paid out even if the target amount has not been reached. There are NO duplicates in the record. The split data record contains the following columns (including meaning):

-funded_amount ... amount received / paid amount in USD at the end of the crowdfunding period
-loan_amount ... Target amount (amount that you wanted to achieve with funding) in USD
-activity ... Sub-category to which the goal of crowdfunding belongs thematically
-sector ... main category in which the crowdfunding topic falls
-use ... Brief description of what the money should be used for
-country_code ... Country code according to ISO standard
-country ... country name according to ISO standard
-region ... Region
-currency ... Currency in which the funded_amount was then paid out
-term in months ... Duration over which the loan is to be paid out
-lender_count ... Lender (i.e. how many people gave money for the project)
-borrower_genders ... gender and number of borrowers, i.e. those who initiated the crowdfunding project
-repayment interval ... repayment modalities / frequency
